base_model.py
This Python module contains the BaseModel class which serves as the base class for other models in the application. It provides common attributes and methods that can be inherited by subclasses.

Attributes
id: A unique identifier for each instance, generated using uuid.
created_at: The date and time when an instance is created, set to the current date and time.
updated_at: The date and time when an instance is updated, set to the current date and time.
Methods
__init__(self, *args, **kwargs): The constructor method for the class. It initializes the id, created_at, and updated_at attributes. If kwargs is provided, it sets the attributes of the instance based on the key-value pairs in kwargs.

__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the instance, including the class name, id, and dictionary of the instance.

save(self): Updates the updated_at attribute with the current date and time.
